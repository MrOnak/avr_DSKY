- verify move millis() interrupt to timer2 
- implement infoLights as shift registers
	if we pack the existing 7-segment displays in 5 blocks of 8 bit (3 spare), we can pack 11 additional bits in a total of 6 registers
- implement bar graph display. requires one PWM port per bar graph
- replace mock-up function ISR_TIMER0_OVF_vect() in dsky.c with proper implementation
- extend DSKY so that the warning light thresholds for the following will become configurable
  FROM WITHIN the DSKY itself:
	- DSKY_THRES_UPLINK	5
	- DSKY_THRES_GLOC 	5
	- DSKY_THRES_FUEL 	0.1
