Alternative approach to KSPIO-ish things
  instead of pushing every single kind of data every time
	why not use a request/response protocol where the microcontroller
	decides what information it needs and thus trading I/O bandwidth
	for a bit of processing power:
	- The microcontroller would send a command to the KSP plugin which 
	  data pieces it needs. 
	- The KSP plugin stores that information and sends only those
	  pieces from then on. 
  - the microcontroller will have to keep track of which data sets
	  were requested last as that determines the order of incoming
		data
