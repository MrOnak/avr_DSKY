CHANGELOG
2014.10.09
- reduced .hex file size from 44265 to 43889 byte
- added dskyDisplay_setValue() implementing uint32 to digits conversion via
    ulpow() from dskyDisplay_update()
- removed dskyDisplay_update()
- adapted dsky.c code to call dskyDisplay_setValue()
- added infolight logic for VERB and NOUN
- combines switch() statements for VERB and NOUN in dsky_updateDisplayData()
- change infoLights again:
    - let the three MSBs from sr5 go to waste
	- add 6th and 7th shift registers solely for the infoLights
	- this will enable me to have 2 additional lights for VERB and NOUN when 
	  those are meant to be entered by the user
- repacked 7-segment displays in 5 blocks of 8 bit (3 spare), we can pack 11 
    additional bits in a total of 6 registers for use with infoLights
- implemented infoLights as shift registers

2014.10.08
- reduced .hex file size from 45995 to 44265 byte
- reworked many of the #defines
- got rid of NOUN_PROG constants, allowing up to 99 programs
- removed arrayPos8() and arrayPos16() - replaced with range-check #defines
- reduced .hex file size from 45995 byte to 44265

2014.10.06
- got rid of the DSKY_DISPLAY_FI_* and DSKY_DISPLAY_RES_* defines, using 
    DSKY_NOUN_* instead
- move info light flags in structs into a single uint16_t bitfield to save 
    memory
- moved millis() interrupt handler to TIMER2 to free up the TIMER0 used by 
    display.c
