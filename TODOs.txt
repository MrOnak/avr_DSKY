- verify move millis() interrupt to timer2 
- ulpow() is called in dskyDisplay_update() even when a number hasn't changed
    this eats a lot of performance
- implement bar graph display. requires one PWM port per bar graph
- replace mock-up function ISR_TIMER0_OVF_vect() in dsky.c with proper 
    implementation
- extend DSKY so that the warning light thresholds for the following will 
    become configurable
  FROM WITHIN the DSKY itself:
	- DSKY_THRES_UPLINK	5
	- DSKY_THRES_GLOC 	5
	- DSKY_THRES_FUEL 	0.1
