- verify move millis() interrupt to timer2 
- see if we can move the PROG constants to their own namespace, beginning with 01 and allowing up to 99 programs to be defined
- arrayPos() in utilities.c must use pointers for array access
- verify arrayPos() works as intended
- does it make sense to update infoLight shift-registers independently from the 7-segment display ones?
	if we pack the existing 7-segment displays in 5 blocks of 8 bit (3 spare), we can pack 11 additional bits in a total of 6 registers
- does it make sense to update the bar graph data independently from the 7-segment displays?
	depends on the protocol used to address the bar graph ICs
- replace mock-up function ISR_TIMER0_OVF_vect() in dsky.c with proper implementation
- extend DSKY so that the warning light thresholds for the following will become configurable
  FROM WITHIN the DSKY itself:
	- DSKY_THRES_UPLINK	5
	- DSKY_THRES_GLOC 	5
	- DSKY_THRES_FUEL 	0.1
