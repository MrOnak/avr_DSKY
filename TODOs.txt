- add display flicker as electric charge on vessel runs below 2% (or so)
	requires a digital pin
	
- replace mock-up function ISR_TIMER0_OVF_vect() in dsky.c with proper
	implementation
	
- implement restart command

- change display.c to use SPI instead of bitbanging it

- double check all timers and interrupts, adapt according to tests/combined

- work on proper functionality for UPLINK ACTY info light

- find out why the percentage calculation for the bargraphs is off by so
	much (multiplyer of 147 instead of 255) and more importantly why the
	bargraph on timer2 is different from the other 2 - I suspect a conflict
	with millis.c, which also uses the timer
	
- extend DSKY so that the warning light thresholds become configurable 
	FROM WITHIN the DSKY itself.
	
- similar to making the warning light thresholds configurable it might
	be feasible to have an option to enter vehicle launch mass and current
	ISP (as examples) and have the DSKY calculate the net weight of the 
	vehicle due to loss of fuel / rcs and calculate the deltaV available
	and other statistics from that.

- extend thresholds in dsky.h according to tests/combined

- extend infoLights to uint32_t and adapt bitmask constants as per tests/combined
	
- add configurables
	- all thresholds
	- vehicle wet mass (assuming full tanks)
	- vehicle ISP
	- SOI
