- change code to utilize hardware SPI to fill the shift registers
- add display flicker as electric charge on vessel runs below 2% (or so)
    requires a digital pin
- verify move millis() interrupt to timer2
- implement bar graph display. requires one PWM port per bar graph
- replace mock-up function ISR_TIMER0_OVF_vect() in dsky.c with proper
    implementation
- find out why the percentage calculation for the bargraphs is off by so
  much (multiplyer of 147 instead of 255) and more importantly why the
	bargraph on timer2 is different from the other 2 - I suspect a conflict
	with millis.c, which also uses the timer
- extend DSKY so that the warning light thresholds become configurable 
	FROM WITHIN the DSKY itself.
- similar to making the warning light thresholds configurable it might
  be feasible to have an option to enter vehicle launch mass and current
	ISP (as examples) and have the DSKY calculate the net weight of the 
	vehicle due to loss of fuel / rcs and calculate the deltaV available
	and other statistics from that.
